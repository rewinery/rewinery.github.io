Today is actually a very busy day. I took an exam in the morning. I should have been taking the exam until 10:30 a.m.. But I handed in the paper at 9:30 and then returned to dormitary, in order to take the Leetcode weekly contest, well, and sleep, for I slept late yesterday.

But it was too early when I arrived at the dormitary, so I started to play computer games. And finally it was [brealid](https://brealid.cn)'s message made me realize that the contest had begun for half an hour.

Then I hurried to take part in the contest. Though I was late, I achieved a good ranking. Just keep pushing forward.
